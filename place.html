            <ol>
                <li>Deekshabhoomi marks the spot where Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and around 400,000–600,000 followers converted to Buddhism on 14 October 1956, a pivotal event in India's social reform movement</li>
                <li>Inspired by the ancient Sanchi Stupa, the Deekshabhoomi stupa is a 120 ft‑tall hollow structure, accommodating up to 5,000 people in its internal prayer hall</li>
                <li>Constructed using an innovative Central Block Locking System, the stupa stands on a ground floor measuring 211 × 211 ft with concentric layers of 16 and 24 columns supporting the dome</li>
                <li>At its center lies the asthikalash, containing Dr. Ambedkar’s mortal remains, surrounded by a Buddha statue, exhibition hall, Bodhi Tree saplings from Sri Lanka, and a Buddha Vihara</li>
                <li>Spread across 22 acres, open 24/7 with no entry fee, and classified as an A‑class tourism/pilgrimage site, Deekshabhoomi draws millions of pilgrims and tourists, especially on Dhamma Chakra Pravartan Din (Ashoka Vijayadashmi) every October </li>

            <center style="color: rgb(245, 229, 242);"><h1>Ambazari Lake</h1></center>
            <ol>
                <li>Ambazari Lake, built in 1870 by the Bhonsle dynasty, is the city’s biggest lake, supplying water to officials for over three decades and serving as the source of the Nag River</li>
                <li>The name “Ambazari” comes from the Marathi word “Amba” (mango), owing to the abundant mango orchards planted around the lake  a legacy of its origins </li>
                <li>Adjacent to the lake is the Ambazari Garden, established in 1958, spanning roughly 18–20 acres. It features walking trails, green gym setups, a children’s play area, toy train, and once included a musical fountain</li>
                <li>Visitors enjoy paddle and row boating, especially during sunset. The lake’s tranquil setting and abundant greenery make it a favorite for nature lovers and bird-watchers</li>
                <li>During heavy rains, the lake can overflow, contributing to nearby floods. In response, local authorities are working to remove water hyacinth and reinforce the embankments ahead of monsoons</li>
